			<p align="center">  The plot above shows the correlation between the % of population
				living below the poverty line and the heart condition in the US . As shown in the chart, 
			there seems to be a clear positive relationship between the two variables ; As poverty level increases
			the heart conditions tend to deteriorate . Further, while most 50 states are clustered within
			 a poverty rate of 10-20%, Puerto Rico appears to be an outlier with a poverty rate little less than 50% and with the highest level of heart condition 
           deterioration felt by surveyed individuals </p>
